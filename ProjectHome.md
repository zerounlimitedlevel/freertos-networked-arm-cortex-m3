**A NOTE ON LICENSES**
In order to use existing code from for the LuminaryMicro chips
This project **SHALL NOT INCLUDE** code under what has come to be known as "viral" licenses.

Quote from headers:   _"viral" open-source software_

An example on the net is the GPL.  Which I know and love... but, I want to develop a project using LuminaryMicro based chips and so this rule stands.  Any code which is under the GPL or other type license may NOT be checked into this code base.  If found it should be reported for removal.
